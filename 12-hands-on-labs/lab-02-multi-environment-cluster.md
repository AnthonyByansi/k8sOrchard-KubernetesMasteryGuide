# Hands-on Lab: Managing Multi-Environment Clusters

Welcome to the **Managing Multi-Environment Clusters** hands-on lab! In this lab, you'll gain practical experience in setting up and managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will:

1. Create and configure separate Kubernetes clusters for different environments.
2. Deploy applications to these clusters using environment-specific configurations.
3. Implement strategies for versioning and managing configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Kubernetes cluster for each environment (development, testing, production).
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured to access each cluster.
- A version control system (e.g., Git) for managing configuration files.

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Clusters

1. Create separate Kubernetes clusters for development, testing, and production.
2. Configure `kubectl` to switch between contexts for each cluster.

### Step 2: Create Environment-Specific Configurations

1. For each environment, create configuration files with appropriate settings.
2. Use Kubernetes namespaces to isolate applications in each environment.

### Step 3: Deploy Applications

1. Use `kubectl` to apply environment-specific configuration files.
2. Verify that applications are running in the correct namespaces.

### Step 4: Versioning Configurations

1. Use a version control system to manage configuration files.
2. Implement a branching strategy for different environments.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the **Managing Multi-Environment Clusters** hands-on lab. This lab provided practical experience in setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters across different environments. You now have the skills to efficiently manage applications in various stages of development and deployment.

**Next:** Continue exploring hands-on labs to deepen your understanding of Kubernetes concepts and practices.
