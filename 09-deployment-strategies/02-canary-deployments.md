# Canary Deployments in Kubernetes

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Canary Deployments** section in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll explore how you can safely introduce new versions of your applications to a subset of users using Canary Deployments, minimizing risks and gaining insights into the impact of changes.

## Key Concepts

### Canary Deployments Overview

**Canary Deployments** gradually roll out new versions to a subset of users or Pods, allowing you to monitor and test changes before full deployment.

### Controlled Rollouts

Canary Deployments enable controlled testing and validation of new versions in a real-world environment.

## Implementing Canary Deployments

### Configuration Steps

To implement a Canary Deployment:

1. Create a new deployment with the updated version of your application.
2. Gradually adjust the traffic distribution to direct a portion of users to the new deployment.

### Example Canary Deployment YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-canary
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-new-image:latest
```

## Traffic Shifting and Monitoring

### Gradual Traffic Shift

Use Kubernetes Service resources or Ingress controllers to direct a portion of traffic to the Canary Deployment.

### Monitoring and Validation

Monitor key metrics, user behavior, and application performance during the Canary Deployment.

## Rollback or Promotion

### Decision Points

Based on the monitoring results, decide whether to promote the Canary Deployment to full production or perform a rollback.

### Promotion Command:

```shell
kubectl scale deployment my-app-canary --replicas=5
```

## Success Strategies

### Clear Metrics

Define success criteria and metrics before deploying the Canary version.

### Monitoring Tools

Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gather data and analyze performance.

## Conclusion

Canary Deployments offer a strategic approach to introducing changes to your applications while mitigating risks. By gradually exposing a subset of users to new versions, monitoring their behavior, and making informed decisions, you can ensure a smooth transition and high-quality updates.
