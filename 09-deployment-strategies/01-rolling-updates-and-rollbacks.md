# Rolling Updates and Rollbacks in Kubernetes

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks** section in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll delve into strategies for deploying new versions of your applications while minimizing downtime using rolling updates, as well as how to revert to previous versions using rollbacks.

## Key Concepts

### Deployment Strategies

**Rolling Updates** ensure seamless transitions between application versions, while **rollbacks** provide a safety net in case issues arise.

### Zero Downtime

Rolling updates maintain application availability by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.

## Performing Rolling Updates

### Configuration Steps

To perform a rolling update:

1. Update the container image or configuration in the deployment.
2. Apply the changes, and Kubernetes will automatically orchestrate the update.

### Example Rolling Update Command:

```shell
kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-app=my-new-image:latest
```

## Monitoring Rolling Updates

### Monitoring Progress

Kubernetes offers various tools to monitor rolling updates, such as `kubectl rollout status`.

### Pause and Resume

You can pause and resume rolling updates to investigate issues or allow changes to propagate.

## Rollbacks

### Rollback Mechanism

In case of issues post-update, you can use rollbacks to revert to the previous stable version.

### Rollback Command:

```shell
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app
```

## Strategies for Success

### Version Control

Maintain a versioned codebase and container images to enable efficient rollbacks.

### Canary Deployments

Consider using **Canary Deployments** to gradually introduce new versions to a subset of users.

## Conclusion

Rolling updates and rollbacks are essential deployment strategies in Kubernetes that ensure your applications are resilient and maintain high availability. By understanding how to perform rolling updates, monitor progress, and perform rollbacks when needed, you can confidently manage application updates.
