# Managing Nodes with DaemonSets

In this section, we'll explore **DaemonSets** in Kubernetesâ€”a resource designed to ensure a specific Pod runs on every node in the cluster, facilitating tasks that need to be performed on each node.

## Introduction to DaemonSets

A **DaemonSet** ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on every node in the cluster. It's commonly used for tasks like monitoring agents, log collectors, and network plugins.

## Use Cases for DaemonSets

DaemonSets are useful for scenarios that require:

- **Cluster-Wide Operations:** Ensuring a task runs on every node.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Running agents on every node to collect data.
- **Network Operations:** Deploying network plugins that modify node network settings.

## Creating a DaemonSet

Here's an example of defining a DaemonSet:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-agent
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: agent-container
          image: monitoring-agent-image
```
