# Namespaces: Logical Clusters within Kubernetes

Welcome to the section on **Namespaces** in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll explore how Namespaces allow you to create virtual clusters within a single Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction to Namespaces

**Namespaces** provide a way to logically segregate resources within a cluster. They help organize and manage applications, services, and other resources, preventing naming conflicts.

### Creating a Namespace

To create a Namespace, you define a `Namespace` resource and assign resources to it.

Example `Namespace` definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: development
```

## Using Namespaces

Namespaces are useful for:

- **Resource Segregation:** Isolating resources by team, environment, or application.
- **Access Control:** Applying RBAC to control access within a Namespace.
- **Resource Quotas:** Limiting resource consumption within a Namespace.

## Default and System Namespaces

Kubernetes comes with several default namespaces, such as `default`, `kube-system`, and `kube-public`. These namespaces are reserved for system components and should not be deleted or modified.

## Conclusion

With Namespaces, you can create a clean and organized structure within your Kubernetes cluster, ensuring resources are isolated and manageable.

**Next:** Explore **Resource Quotas** to manage resource usage within Namespaces effectively.
