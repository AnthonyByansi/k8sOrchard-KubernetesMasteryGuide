# Managing Stateful Applications with StatefulSets

In this section, we'll delve into **StatefulSets** in Kubernetesâ€”a powerful resource designed for managing stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage.

## Introduction to StatefulSets

A **StatefulSet** is a controller for managing stateful applications, providing stable and unique network identities for each Pod and allowing them to maintain their identity across rescheduling.

## Use Cases for StatefulSets

StatefulSets are ideal for applications that require:

- **Ordered Scaling:** Applications that need to scale in a predictable order.
- **Unique Identity:** Each Pod having its own stable identity, hostname, and network identity.
- **Persistent Storage:** Applications with data that needs to persist across rescheduling.

## Creating a StatefulSet

Here's an example of defining a StatefulSet:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
```

## Scaling StatefulSets

Scaling StatefulSets can be done by updating the `replicas` field in the StatefulSet's definition:

```shell
kubectl scale statefulset mysql --replicas=5
```
