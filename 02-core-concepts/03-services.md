# Kubernetes Services: Connecting and Load Balancing

In this section, we'll dive into **Services** in Kubernetes, which enable communication between Pods and provide load balancing across them.

## Introduction to Services

A **Service** is an abstraction that defines a set of Pods and a policy for accessing them. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name that other Pods in the cluster can use to communicate with the service.

## Types of Services

Kubernetes supports different types of Services:

- **ClusterIP:** Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP address, reachable only from within the cluster.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on a static port on each node's IP, allowing external access.
- **LoadBalancer:** Automatically creates an external load balancer to expose the Service.
- **ExternalName:** Maps the Service to a DNS name, allowing Pods to access external services.

## Creating a Service

Here's an example of creating a ClusterIP Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
    tier: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```
## Load Balancing
Services automatically load balance traffic across all healthy Pods belonging to the Service. This helps distribute traffic and ensures high availability.
