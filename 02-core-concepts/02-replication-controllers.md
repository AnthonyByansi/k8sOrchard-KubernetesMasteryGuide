# Managing Replication with Kubernetes

In this section, we'll explore **Replication Controllers** in Kubernetes, a critical component for ensuring the desired number of identical Pod replicas are running at all times.

## Replication Controllers: Ensuring High Availability

A **Replication Controller** is responsible for managing the lifecycle of replicated Pods, ensuring a specified number of copies are running. If a Pod fails or is deleted, the Replication Controller replaces it to maintain the desired state.

## Creating a Replication Controller

Here's an example of defining a Replication Controller:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: frontend-controller
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: web
    tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: web-app
          image: my-web-app-image
```

## Scaling Replicas
You can scale the number of replicas by updating the replicas field in the Replication Controller's definition:
`kubectl scale rc frontend-controller --replicas=5`

## Revisions and Rollbacks
When updating a Replication Controller's Pod template, it creates a new revision. This allows for easy rollbacks in case of issues with a new version.
