Welcome to the section on **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll explore how to manage configuration data and sensitive information within your applications.

## Introduction to ConfigMaps

**ConfigMaps** allow you to decouple configuration data from your application code. This makes it easier to manage and update configuration without modifying the application itself.

### Creating a ConfigMap

To create a ConfigMap, you define a `ConfigMap` resource and provide key-value pairs or configuration files.

Example `ConfigMap` definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  app.properties: |
    database.url=example.com
    database.port=5432
```

## Introduction to Secrets

**Secrets** are used to manage sensitive information like passwords, API tokens, and keys. Secrets are stored securely and can be mounted into Pods as files or environment variables.

### Creating a Secret

To create a Secret, you define a `Secret` resource and provide the sensitive data.

Example `Secret` definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=  # Base64-encoded
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # Base64-encoded
```

## Using ConfigMaps and Secrets

- **ConfigMaps:** Useful for non-sensitive configuration that needs to be shared with multiple Pods.
- **Secrets:** Ideal for storing sensitive data that needs to be accessed securely by Pods.

## Conclusion

With ConfigMaps and Secrets, you can manage configuration and sensitive information effectively, keeping your applications flexible and secure.
