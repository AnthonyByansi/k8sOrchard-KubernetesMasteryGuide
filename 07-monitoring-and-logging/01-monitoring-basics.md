# Monitoring Basics in Kubernetes

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Monitoring Basics** section in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll explore the importance of monitoring your cluster and applications, and introduce key concepts and tools for effective monitoring.

## Key Concepts

### Monitoring and Observability

**Monitoring** involves collecting and tracking metrics to understand the health and performance of your systems. **Observability** takes this a step further, providing insights into system behavior, even during complex scenarios.

### Metrics and Logs

- **Metrics:** Quantitative data about resource usage, performance, and behavior.
- **Logs:** Textual records of events and actions within your applications and cluster.

## Kubernetes Metrics

### Metrics Server

The **Metrics Server** is a core component that collects resource utilization and performance metrics from your cluster's nodes and Pods.

### Pod Metrics

Metrics Server provides metrics at the Pod level, including CPU and memory usage.

## Monitoring Tools

### Prometheus

**Prometheus** is a popular open-source monitoring system that collects and stores metrics, allowing querying and alerting.

### Grafana

**Grafana** is a visualization and monitoring tool that works seamlessly with Prometheus to create custom dashboards and alerts.

### Example Prometheus Query:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total{job="api"}[5m])
```

## Centralized Logging

### Logging Challenges

Centralized logging is essential for aggregating and analyzing logs from multiple sources.

### Fluentd and Fluent Bit

**Fluentd** and **Fluent Bit** are popular log collection and forwarding solutions for Kubernetes clusters.

## Conclusion

Monitoring and observing your Kubernetes cluster and applications are vital to ensuring their performance, reliability, and security. By mastering monitoring tools like Prometheus and logging solutions like Fluentd, you can proactively manage your cluster and applications.
