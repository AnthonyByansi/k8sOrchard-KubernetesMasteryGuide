# Container Security in Kubernetes

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Container Security** section in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll delve into best practices and techniques to enhance the security of your application containers running within the cluster.

## Key Concepts

### Container Security Challenges

Securing containers involves addressing vulnerabilities, protecting runtime environments, and ensuring secure configurations.

### Vulnerability Management

Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair. Patch vulnerabilities by updating base images and dependencies.

## Secure Container Images

### Immutable Infrastructure

Treat container images as immutable artifacts. Avoid making changes directly within running containers.

### Image Signing and Verification

Sign container images using cryptographic signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of images.

### Pod Security Context

Configure a **Pod Security Context** to set security-related attributes at the Pod level, such as user privileges and SELinux settings.

## Resource Limits and Requests

### Limit Resource Consumption

Use resource limits and requests to prevent containers from consuming excessive resources and affecting other applications.

### Example Resource Limits:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "0.5"
```

## Container Runtime Security

### Runtime Options

Choose secure runtime options like **containerd** or **CRI-O**, and ensure you're running the latest versions.

### AppArmor and SELinux

Use mandatory access controls like **AppArmor** or **SELinux** to restrict container capabilities and actions.

## Conclusion

Securing your containerized applications within Kubernetes is paramount to ensuring the stability and integrity of your cluster. By implementing container security best practices, you can confidently deploy and manage applications with reduced risk.
