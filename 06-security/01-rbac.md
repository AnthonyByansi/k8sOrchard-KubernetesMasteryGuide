# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** section in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll dive into how RBAC allows you to define fine-grained permissions and access control for various users and components within the cluster.

## Key Concepts

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is a Kubernetes feature that enables you to manage who can access what resources and perform specific actions in the cluster. It's a critical aspect of securing your Kubernetes environment.

### Entities in RBAC

- **User:** An individual interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Group:** A collection of users, simplifying access management.
- **Service Account:** An identity for Pods within the cluster.

### RBAC Resources

- **Role:** Defines permissions within a specific namespace.
- **ClusterRole:** Defines permissions across the entire cluster.
- **RoleBinding:** Binds a Role to a user or group within a namespace.
- **ClusterRoleBinding:** Binds a ClusterRole to a user or group.

## Defining Roles and ClusterRoles

To define roles and cluster roles:

1. Specify API resources (e.g., pods, services) and operations (e.g., get, list, create).
2. Organize these permissions into a role definition.

### Example Role for Pod Management:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-manager
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create"]
```

## Binding Roles

After defining roles, you need to bind them to users or service accounts.

### Example RoleBinding:

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: pod-manager-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: alice
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-manager
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## Conclusion

RBAC plays a pivotal role in securing your Kubernetes cluster by controlling who can access resources and perform actions. Mastering RBAC empowers you to manage access effectively and ensure the security of your applications.
