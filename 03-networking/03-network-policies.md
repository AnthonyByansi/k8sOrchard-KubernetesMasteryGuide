# Network Policies in Kubernetes

Explore the **Network Policies** section in Kubernetes to understand how you can control and secure network communication between Pods by defining access rules.

## Introduction to Network Policies

**Network Policies** are a Kubernetes feature that allow you to specify how groups of Pods are allowed to communicate with each other. They provide granular control over network traffic within the cluster.

## Defining Network Policies

A **Network Policy** is defined using YAML manifests that specify the allowed ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic for Pods. This fine-grained control enhances security and isolation.

Example Network Policy allowing incoming traffic from Pods labeled as `app: frontend`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-ingress
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: backend
```

## NetworkPolicy Types

Kubernetes supports two main types of Network Policies:

- **Ingress:** Controls incoming traffic to Pods based on specified criteria.
- **Egress:** Controls outgoing traffic from Pods to destinations based on rules.

## Enforcing Network Policies

Network Policies are enforced by network plugins, which may differ depending on the Kubernetes cluster setup. Common network plugins like Calico and Cilium provide support for Network Policies.

## Using Network Policies

Network Policies are crucial for securing your cluster and enforcing communication rules between different components. They help reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Kubernetes Network Policies, you can enhance the security and isolation of your applications, ensuring that network traffic is restricted based on defined rules.
