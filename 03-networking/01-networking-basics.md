Welcome to the **Networking Basics** section in Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll delve into the fundamental networking concepts that underlie communication between Pods and Services.

## Understanding Kubernetes Networking

Kubernetes networking involves facilitating communication both within and outside the cluster. Pods within the same cluster should be able to communicate seamlessly, and Services expose a consistent endpoint for accessing applications.

## Pods Communication

Pods within the same node can communicate via `localhost`. Pods across nodes require network communication. Kubernetes sets up a flat network where each Pod gets an IP address from the same range.

## Services and Network Policies

Kubernetes Services enable external access to a set of Pods. Services can be of different types, including `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer`.

**Network Policies** provide a way to control network access to Pods. They allow you to define rules specifying which Pods are allowed to communicate with each other.

## Cluster DNS

Kubernetes has an integrated DNS service that allows you to access Services, Pods, and other resources using their names. This makes it easier to discover and communicate with different components within the cluster.

**Next:** Dive into the advanced concepts of **Ingress** and **Load Balancing**.
